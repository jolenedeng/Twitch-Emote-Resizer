# Twitch-Emote-Resizer
A simple twitch emote resizer to help emote artists (like me) resize their emotes quickly. Requirements: Pillow library installed: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#basic-installation


## Instructions:

Add images you wish to resize in a .jpg file to the home directory then run the script.
Resized images will appear in the /resized_emote folder. 

``` 
python main.py
```
